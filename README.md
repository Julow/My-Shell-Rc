# Futhark syntax highlighting for Vim

This repo is fanmade and so far has no connection to the developers of
Futhark. See https://futhark-lang.org/ for more info on the langauge.

If you have Vundle installed simply add the following to your .vimrc between
`call vundle#begin()` and `call vundle#end()`:

```
Plugin 'BeneCollyridam/futhark-vim'
```

Otherwise simply run the install script:

```bash
$ bash install.sh
```

A lot of keywords, definitions, etc. has been taken from
https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/master/tools/futhark.lang
